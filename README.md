## ⚙️ Dynamic Pricing Model

The application calculates the total price by first determining the cost per unit and then multiplying it by the selected quantity.

**Price Per Unit Calculation:**
$$
\text{Price}_{\text{Unit}} = \text{Base Price} + \text{Color Modifier} + \text{Size Modifier}
$$

**Total Price Calculation:**
$$
\text{Total Price} = \text{Price}_{\text{Unit}} \times \text{Quantity}
$$

This calculation is implemented using the **`useMemo` hook** in the product component for efficient, real-time updates.
